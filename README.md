# Genetic-Algorithm

Uses genetic algorithm to train a model to play a self-made game. Basically just a simple game, move left or right to avoid projectiles to achieve highest possible score.

Run pokemon_game.py to play it manually.

Run pokemon_game_AI.py to experience the training process.

Run BestGen.py to watch how AI beat the game.
